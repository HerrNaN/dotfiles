#+TITLE: README

* Introduction
This repository hosts the dotfiles (among other things) that I use to configure my system the way *I* like it.
Feel free to use or fork it!
** Dotfiles
The dotfiles are setup using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]], a utility that lets you symlink config files from this repo into your system.
** System setup
The repo also contains configurations for [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman][pacman]] along with the explicitly installed packages used in my system.
To install the configuration and the packages run ~./install-packages.sh~.
